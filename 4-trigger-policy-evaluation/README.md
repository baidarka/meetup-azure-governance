# Trigger an evaluation cycle

A policy evaluation cycle will trigger every so often, and the duration of the cycle may take time.  
Luckily, you can trigger an evaluation cycle.

- Review the script
- Run the script with the Verbose flag: `./Start-PolicyEvaluation.ps1 -Verbose`
  (This script waits for the evaluation to complete, which may take a while.)
